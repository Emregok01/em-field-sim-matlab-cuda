# em-field-sim-matlab-cuda
This project simulates 2D/3D electromagnetic fields using MATLAB, with CUDA acceleration for high-performance parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs. The goal is to visualize and analyze electromagnetic behavior in real-time or near-real-time environments using GPU-based computations.
